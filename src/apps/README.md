# Main scripts
Several scripts are available. Each of them have different purposes. 
- `e4nuanalysis`: it runs the main analysis. From an input root file containing the events, it will process the file and store only the events that satisfy the event selection. 
- `radiate_flux`: computes the radiated flux given an electron beam energy.
